# üìä Analytical Models in Excel

This repository showcases a range of analytical models implemented directly in Microsoft Excel, demonstrating both statistical understanding and advanced spreadsheet proficiency. As a data analytics student, I created this workbook to serve as a portfolio piece illustrating my hands-on ability to analyze data, build predictive models, and present findings in a clean, structured format - all using Excel's native features.

## üìÅ Workbook Overview

The workbook includes the following sheets:

| **Sheet Name**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression**               | Predicts exam scores based on study hours and exam preparation. Includes manual calculation of coefficients, performance metrics, and a summary output.                    |
| **Principal Component Analysis**    | Manual calculation of covariance matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and principal components for a standardized feature set.                                            |
| **Decision Tree Calculation**       | A rule-based decision tree example using categorical features (e.g. likes ice cream/chocolate). Uses entropy-based logic with branching conditions.                        |
| **Logistic Model Evaluation**       | Detailed logistic regression model using multiple predictors. Contains odds ratios, interpretations of coefficients, predicted probabilities, and error types (Type I/II). |
| **Vector Prediction Decision Tree** | Manual calculation for an overfit vector prediction decision tree compared to a code generated one.                                                                        |
| **K-Fold Cross-Validation**         | Performs 5-fold cross-validation on a machine failure dataset. Calculates fold-based splits, tracks performance, and helps evaluate model generalizability.                |
| **Logistic Regression**             | Manual implementation of logistic regression on binary classification (machine working vs not). Includes logit function, probabilities, and log-likelihoods.               |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**             | Basic setup for KNN classification. Graphical representation included.                                                                                                     |

## üß† Why Excel?

While programming languages like Python and R are industry standards for analytics, Excel remains an invaluable tool ‚Äî especially in business environments. This project demonstrates how deep analytical work can be achieved even in Excel, making concepts more transparent and accessible.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open the `Analytical_Models_In_Excel.xlsx` file.
2. Navigate through the tabs to explore each model.
3. Use in-sheet comments, formula breakdowns, and labeled sections to follow the logic step-by-step.
